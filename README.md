# Web Time Capsule

Web Time Capsule is a collection of simple static HTML pages that together form an experimental “time capsule” of the web. Each file represents a standalone snapshot, making this project useful for learning basic web layout, archiving designs, or hosting a lightweight multi-page site.

## Features

- Multiple numbered HTML pages (0.html, 1.html, 2.html, etc.) that act as individual snapshots or chapters.
- Pure HTML/CSS with no external frameworks, keeping the project easy to read and modify for beginners.
- MIT-licensed codebase that can be reused or extended in personal or educational projects. [web:5]

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/endritngjelina/Web-Time-Capsule.git
cd Web-Time-Capsule
2. Open any of the HTML files (for example `Web Time Capsule 0.html`) in your browser by double-clicking or using a local HTTP server.
3. Navigate between the different pages to explore the various snapshots.

## Customization

- Edit the HTML files with any text editor to change content, styling, or layout.
- Add new pages by copying an existing HTML file and updating its content and filename (for example `Web Time Capsule 12.html`).
- Optionally host the project with GitHub Pages by enabling Pages in the repository settings and pointing it to the `main` branch. [web:5]
